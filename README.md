## Part 1

<br />
The first thing I did was git clone (pasted the url from github) <br />
Then once I had the files, I went to the handler class to read the code and help me write a method for StringSearch.java<br />
After that, I made sure to use the correct inputs for a url link such as "=", "s" and "\n" with all the correct inputs. :) <br />
<br />

<br />
The next step is to run the file on the terminal then open the link, then paste "/add-message?s=Coffee" onto the URL <br />

To test the method averageWithoutLowest, first we created a list of doubles. Example {0.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0} We are testing whether of not the method drops the lowest number and then find the mean of the remaining numbers. <br /> We used the assertEquals statement with the expected being 3.0, since 2.0+3.0+4.0 = 9 /3 = 3, and the delta value of 0.0 so no tolerance of error. <br /> The expected and actual value were both 3 so the method, averageWithoutLowest is correct. <br />

I've learned that debugging with others is a much better way to go about debugging. Two brains are better than one!
